# hamburger-menu
> A simple burger menu component built with React and with the added challenge of using *hooks*, *context*, conditional rendering, [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) and [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/).\

This is not a finished product but a coding exercise to make a reusable component that can be inserted in different projects after more styling.

When screen is wide, a plain navbar is diplayed, and when screen is small (smartphone small) the navbar is replaced by a burger menu.
